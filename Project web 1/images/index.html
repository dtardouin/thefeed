            <p>The Feed. I plan on making my feed tropical themed. The gif on the first page
                will be of a tropical fruit tree droping a fruit that then splaters onto the page
                and displays the words "The Feed" You can then click on it to enter the feed. Where 
                the background will be of tropical plants and vibrant colors.

                    homework.

                <p>Most of my digital use during the day is through the apple wallet one card. This
                    allows me to access the gym to practice, my dorm, and classes. As well as pay for

                    efficiently without needing someone to pass the ball. It allows you to adjust where 
                    you want to shoot, how many shots at each spot, the force that the ball is passed out with,
                   and it tracks your makes and misses at each spot while also totalling and such.
